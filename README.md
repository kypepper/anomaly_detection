# anomaly_detection
Detects anomalies, makes predictions, and calculates risk factor.

Python-based dashboard application designed for real-time visualization of stock market trends, anomaly detection using machine learning algorithms, and predicting future stock prices based on technical analysis indicators and linear regression models.

-Developed a comprehensive dashboard using Dash and Plotly for real-time visualization of stock market trends and anomaly detection.
-Implemented machine learning models such as Linear Regression and Isolation Forest for predicting stock prices and detecting anomalies.
-Integrated financial data retrieval using yfinance API for fetching historical stock data.
-Applied advanced technical analysis indicators like On-Balance Volume (OBV), Aroon Indicator, and ADX -Indicator for market insights.
-Utilized data preprocessing techniques including feature scaling and imputation for model training.

*I am still constantly updating my program to add more features and make my training more accurate. I coded everything including the UI.
